# Dashboard_with_plotly
This repository is dedicated to performing Interactive visual data analytics using the python libraries dash and plotly.

**Plotly**
* Plotly is widely used for plotting scientific, financial or statistical data. 
  (Plotly is free except if, you want it to host your data)
* We use plotly.py (version that works with python) along with dash (Another python library,
  that renders frontend components usng react.js from withon python).

**Dashboards**
1) **US Domestic Airline flights performance:**
* Here we build a dashboard that provides visualizations of `US Domestic Airline flights performance` as well as its `delay data`
  from the year 2005 to 2020.
* We visualize the data using:
  1) Bar Graph
  2) Line Graph
  3) Choropleth Map
  4) Pie Graph
  5) Tree Map

2) **Bee analytics:**
* Bees play a very important part in the ecosystem as pollinators but unfortunately their population is 
  declining at an alarming rate, here we have a visualization of their population pattern over the years 
  and effect of various bee killing parameters on their population. We have considered data from the US 
  for our analysis.
