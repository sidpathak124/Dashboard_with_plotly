# Dashboard_with_plotly

**What we use**
* Plotly is widely used for plotting scientific, financial or statistical data. 
  (Plotly is free except if, you want it to host your data)
* We use plotly.py (version that works with python) along with dash (Another python library,
  that renders frontend components usng react.js from withon python).

**What we build**
* Here we build a dashboard that provides visualizations of `US Domestic Airline flights performance` as well as its `delay data`
  from the year 2005 to 2020.
* We visualize the data using:
  1) Bar Graph
  2) Line Graph
  3) Choropleth Map
  4) Pie Graph
  5) Tree Map
